## My process

- First of all, I wrote up the HTML structure, planned the elements. Then added classes and wrote CSS. After that I optimized for Media queries.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media queries
- Responsive design - min 375px

### What I learned

In this project, I could go over basics of flexbox, working with rem units and media queries. It helped me to sink in the things that learned before.
